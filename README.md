# /!\ AS IT IS A ZIP BOMB, DO NOT TRY UNZIPPING IT OR EVEN LETTING WINDOWS DEFENDER DO ANY ACTION ABOUT MY ZIP BOMB IN YOUR HOST (as it will extract it trying to delete it...).
I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE CAUSED TO YOUR COMPUTER. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO CREATE A VM TO TEST IT.

SORRY FOR BAD ENGLISH! (i'm not english actually so yeah-)

this zip bomb was created by me. it contains at most (you will understand why i say that later) 28 levels.
the order is : zip (zipped)(1-25) --> zips (zipped)(1-25) --> nest(1-25) --> level(1-25) --> (1-25) --> (a-z) --> (in a letter folder, there is all the letters following it : a will contain b that will contain c, etc...)

it took me around ~5h to generate all the folders manually in a windows vista vm (as i was just playing with hierarchy at the beginning-) for a total size of... 0 B.
0 files, (enter later) folders.

(i will upload the final project to https://github.com/butterfl1es/25/releases later in the day, and upload all the levels to the code section.)
